# On Immeasurable Magnitudes

This is a paper I wrote some time ago, where I demonstrate how to correctly generate prime numbers. The algorithms are very inefficient and only serve the purpose of showing a new way of thinking about prime numbers.
Unfortunately, after many attempts at reaching out to "experts" or people that are more mathematically inclined, I was disappointed and discouraged when the only people who responded--with few exceptions--had very cynical or condescending attitudes (some responded with insults before even reading what I was proposing).

So I timestamped the paper using the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure originality of ideas; I leave this paper here for those who are a bit more open minded and are not immediately dismissive of an academic nobody.

I should emphasize, before you automatically assume, that this method is **NOT** another sieve (and does **NOT** rely on one), at least in the sense of filtering out composites by exhaustive elimination relatively to potential factors (like [the Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)). In fact, it is quite the opposite. Anybody who has programmed the Sieve of Eratosthenes should notice the radically different approach. If I had to compare, I would say that in essence it is a bit similar to the [chaos game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle#Chaos_game) of the [Sierpi≈Ñski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle), where primes are analogous to the computed points that draws the (ever-denser) triangles in the pattern, while the composites are anologous to the (empty) triangular areas we never reach while playing the game to "infinity's end."
